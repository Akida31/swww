Improved cli user interface:
	Simply call:
		fswww <img path | color | query sub | kill sub >
	And we figure out what to do ourselves.
		If we got an 'img path' or a 'color' we must check if the daemon is
		alive. If not, we init it.

Fully automated, complete testing
	- This includes basic memory benchmarking
	- Use criterion for this!

Use generic images in test_images
