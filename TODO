We need to clean up some of the code. In particular, the way we handle the
communication stuff. The socket code looks ugly as hell and is wonky and weird.
It also gives weird error messages on failures.

Stop for like a full weekend and really get to the bottom of where the hell the
memory is going. By my calculations we should be using way, way less memory in
general, but it still insists on going up to nearly 200Mib after opening many
images in a row.

There might be a condition where we send an extra frame after stopping an
animation with the clear command. I haven't seen this yet though.

Fully automated, complete testing, for every option
