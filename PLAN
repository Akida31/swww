These are the steps we will take while developing this program:

	Put a simple white sheet to the background. DONE

	Put a png file instead (zigimg has a png reader). DONE

	Scale the png before printing. DONE

    Run program as a daemon. DONE

	Create a communication procedure with the daemon, that allows for: DONE
		Changing the image. DONE
		Killing the daemon. DONE

	Now fswww should only be run as both a daemon, and a cli program. DONE

	support for selecting the output when sending img path DONE

	If the same img are sent to different monitors, scale them only once. DONE. As long as they are sent together

	support for selecting the filter when switching img path DONE

	animated gif support DONE

	Calculate duration correctly for animation frames. DONE

	Come up with a way to make storing the frames info more memory efficient. PARTIALLY DONE
	CURRENTLY USING LESS CPU THAN MPVPAPER, BUT MORE MEMORY

	CHECK if simple mempoll works. REALLY check it, throughly. Use only one buffer, if it does.


	Make the transition effects when switching rendered files
		^^ THIS ONE IS A BIT UNPREDICTABLE ^^
		When done, communication protocol should be updated to allow for transition effects

	Write logic to make transition between png and gif smoother.
	Write logic to make transition between 2 gifs smoother.

	With all this done, adapt communication procedure to allow for streams
