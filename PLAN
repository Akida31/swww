PROBLEM: STREAM must compress result before sending it back!
SOLUTION: ditch the stream idea, at least for now

PROBLEM: for some reason, memory usage seems to increase unbounded as we switch images during runtime
SOLUTION: this doesn't seem that big of an issue

PROBLEM: see that initializaiton completed with --no-daemon
SOLUTION: during release, log info as well. Say that daemon started with an info. This means rethinking all the info logs and putting them on debug level.


IDEA: refactor code so that we have a manager struct for the bgs, which will do the job currently given to the processor
