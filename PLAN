These are the steps we will take while developing this program:

	Put a simple white sheet to the background. DONE

	Put a png file instead (zigimg has a png reader). DONE

	Scale the png before printing. DONE

    Run program as a daemon. DONE

	Create a communication procedure with the daemon, that allows for: DONE
		Changing the image. DONE
		Killing the daemon. DONE

	Now fswww should only be run as both a daemon, and a cli program. DONE

	support for selecting the output when sending img path DONE

	If the same img are sent to different monitors, scale them only once. DONE. As long as they are sent together

	support for selecting the filter when switching img path DONE

	animated gif support DONE

	Calculate duration correctly for animation frames. DONE

	Come up with a way to make storing the frames info more memory efficient.  DONE
	
	Make QUERY command. This will allow for better automated testing. DONE

	Use socket instead of files for IPC. DONE

	Fix initialization failure: when initializing, if we send a message right after, the daemon fails to receive the message and everything goes to shit. DONE

	The processor might fail on some conditions. But the daemon shouldn't be panicking on those. Fix that.

UNSURE:
	With all this done, adapt communication procedure to allow for streams

PROBLEM: for some reason, memory usage seems to increase unbounded as we switch images during runtime
